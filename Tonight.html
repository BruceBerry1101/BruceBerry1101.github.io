            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night. <br>
             <br>
            Bruce Berry was a working man <br>
            He used to load that Econoline van. <br>
            A sparkle was in his eye <br>
            But his life was in his hands. <br>
             <br>
            Well, late at night <br>
            when the people were gone <br>
            He used to pick up my guitar <br>
            And sing a song in a shaky voice <br>
            That was real as the day was long. <br>
             <br>
            Tonight's the night, yes it is, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, yes it is, <br>
            tonight's the night. <br>
             <br>
            Early in the mornin' <br>
            at the break of day <br>
            He used to sleep <br>
            until the afternoon. <br>
            If you never heard him sing <br>
            I guess you won't too soon. <br>
             <br>
            'Cause people let me tell you <br>
            It sent a chill <br>
            up and down my spine <br>
            When I picked up the telephone  <br>
            And heard that he'd died <br>
            out on the mainline. <br>
             <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>
            tonight's the night. <br>

            Bruce Berry was a working man <br>
            He used to load that Econoline van. <br>
            Well, early in the morning <br>
            at just about the break of day <br>
            He used to sleep <br>
            until the afternoon. <br>
             <br>
            Tonight's the night, yes it is, <br>
            tonight's the night <br>

            tonight's the night <br>
            Tonight's the night, <br>

                    The overall mood of “Old Man” is <a href="goo.gl/Z4Ctq9">positive<br>
                    and nostalgic while most of his songs on<br>
                    Tonight’s the Night are strikingly depressing.</a><br>
                    Though Young was relatively successful at<br>
                    a young age, he is optimistic in the piece<br>
                    that his life can be even better as he sings,<br>
                    “Twenty four and there's so much more”. This<br>
                    optimism and positive feeling is something <br>
                    that is never felt in his Tonight’s the Night.<br>

                    The sound of Young’s voice is fragile,<br>
                    soft, and calm compared to his rough, <br>
                    coarse voice found in his later album, <br>

                    Overall, this drastic change in Young’s<br>
                    music can be directly attributed to the<br>
                    effect that the death of his longtime<br>
                    friend and roadie Bruce Berry had on Young. <br>

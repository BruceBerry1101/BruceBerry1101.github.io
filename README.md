English 1101 'Biography of a Loser' Project
Assignment:  present the biography of a figure from the past who has fallen into obscurity, making a case for why this figure should not be left by the wayside of history. 

For our 'Loser', we chose Bruce Berry, a cocaine addict who worked as a roadie for Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. While roadies are typically the underdogs of performing artists, Berry had a positive impact on CSNY, becoming a close friend of the band, especially Neil Young. Following his death due to an overdose of cocaine, Young experienced a painstaking struggle, as proven through the different sound of the music immediately following.

Dylan Roberto, Daniel Weisman, Reid Lindsey, Cayla Vinzons.

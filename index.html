            was the epitome of a loser.  Born August 3rd 1950, and died June 7th 1973, Berry lived a short life that was as unremarkable as it was pathetic.  In his 23 years he achieved little and squandered a great deal; never married and never having gone to college, Bruce Berry, having alienated his friends and wrecked his meager career, died alone at 23, overdosed on the floor of his shabby apartment. However sad his life was, he is still an important figure in rock history because of the impact his death had on those around him, especially the great folk rock artist Neil Young.</p>

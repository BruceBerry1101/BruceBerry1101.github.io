                The ‘Needle’ is <a href="http://thrasherswheat.org/fot.htm#needle">
                a metaphor</a> for a heroin shot. <br>
                Young's lyrics "I watched the needle<br>
                take another man," is very open-ended;  <br>
                it could refer to the state of euphoria <br>
                obtained through the drug, or the physical <br>
                death as a result of overdoses of heroin. <br>

                The needle also has a <a href="http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot.htm#needle">deeper meaning</a>, <br>
                a record needle. Young sings this song <br>
                to show that he has seen the consequences <br>
                of fame in his friends. Berry was just a <br>
                roadie; he was not famous by any means. <br>
                However, he was always around famous people.<br>
                When Young sings  “I sing the song because <br>
                I love the man. I know that some of you <br>
                don’t understand,” he says that he plays <br>
                music for himself and for his fans, rather<br>
                than for fame. <br>
